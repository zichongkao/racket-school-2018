Racket Summer School
====================
7/9 Matthias talk morning
------------------------
Q: So (f x) takes the entire "form" and stuffs it into x? Is that why displayln x recovers "(f 17)" rather than just 17? Then how

Q: What is (what sounds like) cutter? when someone suggested it as an alternative (second e)?

Q: Are compile time functions always just define-syntax stuff? Since compilers expect syntax?

Q: Important nouns: pattern variable, syntax, identifier, template. What do they mean?

Q: define vs let?

Q: why does "cons?" check if it's a list?

Q: define, define-syntax, define-for-syntax are they just run earlier and earlier?

7/9 Mattias talk afternoon
--------------------------

Q: Why use directives. ie #:do stuff

Q: 

7/10 Matthew Flatt afternoon
----------------------------

Q. What's the difference between a datum-literal and literal?

Q. Syntax-parse vs match vs syntax-case? Is syntax-parse strictly better than the other two?
 - define-syntax-rule is just for basic rearranging use-cases.
 - syntax-case is 30 yo and is superceded by syntax-parse

Q. At which stage is out-if's arguments evaluated?

> (define (our-if condition true-expr false-expr)
    (cond [condition true-expr]
          [else false-expr]))
> (define (display-and-return x)
    (displayln x)
    x)
> (our-if #t (display-and-return "true") (display-and-return "false"))
true
false
"true"
> (cond [#t (display-and-return "true")] [else (display-and-return "false")])
true
"true"

Q. Is the hierarchy module, collection, package?

7/11 Matthew Butterick
----------------------
Q. What makes a good language?
- good ergonomics. Want the right level of verbosity. Don't want to blow up nuclear reactor with a single bit switch. But regex, math want to be compact.

Q. What does "module+" do?

Q. What do readers do? They take arbitrary input and convert them into S-expressions.
What do expanders do? They make bindings for the S-expressions. They can expand stuff with macros too.

7/12 Stephen Chang
------------------

Type systems: "A lightweight syntactic analysis that approximates program behavior"
 - validate function arguments (prevent bugs)
 - check memory safety (avoid malware) (as in rust)
 - verify program properties (prove equivalence)
 
 Matthias says that the Racket book doesnt mention types, but development is entirely "type-driven"
