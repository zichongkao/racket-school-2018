These files contain solutions and scratchwork from the 2018 Racket Summer School.

Kudos to Matthew Butterick (mbutterick), Matthew Flatt (mflatt), Matthias Felleisen (mfelleisen), Stephen Chang (stchang), and Jay McCarthy (jeapostrophe) for the excellent instruction.

The solutions should work on the accompanying test files. I tried to provide as much commentary as I could in comments. Hopefully, learners will find them useful as I have.
