These files contain solutions and scratch work from the 2018 Racket Summer School.

Kudos to @mbutterick, @mflatt, @mfelleisen for the excellent instruction.

The solutions should work on the accompanying test files. I tried to provide as much commentary as I could in comments. Hopefully, learners will find them useful as I have.
